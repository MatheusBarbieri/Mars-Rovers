# Mars-Rovers
This is the resolution of the code challenge: [Mars Rovers](https://github.com/BearchInc/code-challenge/blob/master/challenge2.md); developed in python 3.5.2.

## Usage
* The program must be fed with the input data in stdin.
* The first line of the input is two integer representing the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.
* The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed. Each rover has two lines of input. The first line gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau.
* The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation.

This repository contains a sample file with the example input provided within the challenge.

Example execution call: `python "Mars Rovers\main.py" < "samples\sample.txt"`
